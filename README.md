I want to join The WhiteHats Club because I am deeply interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Being a CSE student, I want to understand how real-world systems are attacked and protected. I want to learn practical security skills and work on real security challenges.

I recently came across the security breach in the U.S. government involving Microsoft 365 that happened in 2023, 2024 and there are still some ongoing concerns about it. In 2023, the attack was done by China-based hackers who forged authentication tokens to access email accounts and in 2024 by Russian hackers who stole corporate emails and passwords. These incidents highlight risks to government agencies using Microsoft's cloud services and concerns about vulnerabilities in cloud security
